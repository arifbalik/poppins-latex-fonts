##Ubuntu LaTeX Font##
This project enables you to use the original Ubuntu Font Familiy (see: hhttp://font.ubuntu.com/) with LaTeX2e.

Current available fonts are Normal, Italic, Bold and BoldItalic and can be envoked using the usual <code>\textit</code>, <code>\textbf</code> commands.

##How to install##

You can either copy all these files into your project or for global use drop all files into the according directories in your TeX-Distribution.

e.g. all *.tfm files go into /usr/share/texmf-texlive/fonts/tfm/

##How to use##

If you want to change mid-in document just add:

	\usefont{T1}{ubuntu}{m}{n}

In case you'd liked to have you entire document be set in the Ubuntu font take this into your preamble:

	\usepackage{ubuntu}

##What is missing##

The fonts where converted as described at http://fachschaft.physik.uni-greifswald.de/~stitch/ttf.html. However they are just bitmaps by now, what definitly has to be changed.

Even so an automated installation (e.g. a nice Makefile) is missing yet.
